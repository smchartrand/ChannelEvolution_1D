# ChannelEvolution_1D
This repository contains Matlab functions which combine as a 1D morphodynamic model of channel profile and bed texture evolution under differing supply conditions. The model is built generally following the Parker e-book (Parker, 2007). The model has been tested under a variety of conditions, but errors are still possible and are solely my fault. The model utilizes the normal depth approximation, the backwater solution via the standard step method, the MPM, Wilcock-Crowe or the Ashia-Michue transport functions, and this version is built for steady flows. The key parameter values are user specified within input worksheets, but some values pertaining to the numerical methods must be changed within the Matlab functions, and it is up to the user to work this out if changes are sought. Model inputs are specified with a Excel workbook, which has been provided with this model build. The workbook contains basic instructions to develop the inputs needed to execute the model.
